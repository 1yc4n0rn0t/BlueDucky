1. Running the file you will be able to load saved bluetooth devices if they are no longer visible but bluetooth is still on - so you can attack them.
2. Any devices you scan will save
3. If no payload.txt is present it will instead send the text "Hello There"

### Duckyscript
- I am still implementing keyboard combinations
- Currently implemented:
  1. REM
  2. STRING
 
So for example (payload.txt)
```bash
REM This is a comment and will not run
STRING type this on their phone hehe
```
